## Overview

I'm obsessed with the craft and delivery of easy to use, accessible and performant  digital services and products at scale. I've been working in design-led digital agencies for 20 years as a full-stack developer, information architect, strategic consultant and team leader. Open source software, web standards and human-centric design are the foundations of my approach. My leadership and engagement skills, deep understanding of brand strategy, user experience and unrelenting focus on quality complement my background in technology.

I've built an award winning development team at Today and led strategy work that has informed the most influential digital transformation projects in the Victorian public sector. I'm now looking for opportunities to lead a new or established product company, working to create impact in partnership with Government clients.
